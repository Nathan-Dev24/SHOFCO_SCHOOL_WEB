				 <li><b>Create a communications plan</b>
					As soon as a potential applicant interacts with our institution, for instance, by downloading a prospectus, their information etc</li>
				 <li><b>Build awareness through outreach</b>
					The second step after outlining our goals is to start implementing our outreach strategies.like advertising through social media and other platforms</li>
				 <li><b> Review applications</b>
					Once the applications start flowing, the reviewing process begins.</li>
				 <li> <b> Nurture successful applicants</b>
					Once our successful students have received confirmation of their admittance, the communication doesn’t stop there. We’ll still need to keep applicants engaged to prevent them from “dropping out“.</li>
				 <li><b>Managing registration</b>
					The final phase of our  recruitment plan  outlines how we’re going to manage the registration process</li>
				 <li><b>Analyse your data</b>
					After registration is complete, we consult the data.</li>
